### My first post!

Hey. I'm Kex and I'm the guy who writes stuff for this blog, and this is my first post. Aside from the welcoming post. Let's skip over that. This being my first ever post, I'll go over some basics about myself, what you should know about me and stuff. So. My name is DÃ¡vid. I'm a Hungarian living in a small town somewhat near the border of the country. I started watching anime at the end of December, in 2017, so I'm fairly new to the media. As to what I love, it's usually Slice of Life, Romance, Comedy or Fantasy, but I like [CGDCT](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=CGDCT) and [Isekai](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=isekai) too. My first anime was [Charlotte](https://anilist.co/anime/20997/Charlotte/), which I actually recently rewatched. It's a great anime, I can only recommend. At the time, I didn't even have a list for the stuff I watch, just noted them down in my head, but after like 7-8 anime, I started forgetting some, so I just registered at MAL. I didn't really like the site, so in the 11th of March, 2018, I moved over to [AniList](https://anilist.co/user/Kex1016/) and I'm still there. My all-time favorite is [K-On](https://anilist.co/anime/5680/KON/), and I don't see that changing ever. Aside from anime, I read a lot of manga, about 70% of them are yuri. Yes. I'm a yurifag and I don't regret it one bit. I hate horror since I'm a pussy and I hate gore cause I get sick of blood. I dislike harem, but that doesn't mean I won't watch/read them if catch my eye. I love listening to music, almost all kinds. If my ear likes it, I won't have a problem listening to it. On my [Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/kex1016), there are 3 playlists, and there's one on my [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/user/minedave/playlist/2Np5XzboIBO4wMF2q1IgsI) too. Most of the songs are weeb though.

That's about it for what I can write now, come back later for more stuff, but I'll probably post it on AniList anyways, so if you follow me there, you won't miss out on a post ;)
